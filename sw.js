/**
 * Service worker — so the app runs with no signal.
 *
 * A takeoff happens in a site trailer, in a truck, or in a house with no
 * roof on it yet. So the whole program — the page, the stylesheet and every
 * module js/main.js can load — is cached when this worker installs, all or
 * nothing (PROGRAM, below). Once one visit on a connection has let that
 * install finish, the app opens offline, including on a device that had
 * never run it before. pdf.js, the materials catalog and the icons are added
 * on top, best-effort (EXTRAS). The copy lasts until the browser clears the
 * site's storage or the next version installs in its place.
 *
 * Project files are never put in this cache: they are the estimator's own
 * documents and run to gigabytes. Plans saved for offline use are kept by
 * the portal's Plans Library, in the origin-private file system, not here.
 *
 * Bump CACHE whenever the app changes, or an installed copy will keep
 * serving the old one. A new module goes in PROGRAM: tests/sw-precache.mjs
 * fails when one main.js can reach is missing, and when an entry names a
 * file that does not exist — that would fail every install.

/**
 * The program, precached on install: the page, the stylesheet, and every

 * it only imports on demand.
 *
 * All of it, up front, because nothing else would cache it in time. The
 * worker registers at `load`, after the page has fetched every module
 * without it, so on a first visit the fetch handler sees none of them. With
 * only the old seven-file shell precached, a device that had never run the
 * app before could not open a saved plan offline: index.html and main.js
 * came from the cache, ./core/takeoff-file.js and the rest got this worker's
 * 503.
 *
 * Relative, every one of them: this app is served from a project subpath on
 * GitHub Pages, not from a domain root.
