/**
 * A plan handed over by the employee portal (Portal 2, portal.dcrframing.com).
 *
 * The old portal shared this app's address (barajas545.github.io), so it
 * handed a project over through sessionStorage and kept its Plans Library in
 * the same private file system this app reads. Portal 2 is another site:
 * nothing of its storage can be read from here, and nothing of a plan may
 * travel in an address (a download link is a credential, and an address ends
 * up in history and in logs). So the hand-over is a conversation between the
 * two windows:
 *
 *   1. the portal opens this app in a new tab at `index.html#portal=<nonce>`
 *      (a one-time random word, no credential), and keeps the tab's window;
 *   2. this app answers its opener `{type: 'ptt-ready', v, nonce}` — posted
 *      ONLY to the portal's own address (PORTAL_ORIGINS), so no other site
 *      that opened this app hears it;
 *   3. the portal posts the plan to this tab, to this app's own address:
 *        {type: 'ptt-open', v, nonce, kind: 'file', file, name, size,
 *         lastModified, number, updateAvailable}
 *          a copy the portal's Plans Library keeps on this device (a File
 *          out of its storage: nothing is copied, this app reads it by slices
 *          like a file from disk) — opens with no internet;
 *        {type: 'ptt-open', v, nonce, kind: 'link', url, name, size,
 *         lastModified, number}
 *          a plan in the OneDrive Plans Archive, opened over HTTP ranges
 *          through a pre-authenticated link (js/core/remote-file.js);
 *   4. when that link expires (about an hour) this app asks the portal tab
 *      for a fresh one: `{type: 'ptt-renew', v, nonce, req}`, answered
 *      `{type: 'ptt-link', v, nonce, req, url}` ('' when there is none);
 *   5. once this device keeps the app for offline use (its service worker in
 *      charge, its program cached), it says `{type: 'ptt-offline', v, nonce}`;
 *   6. a plan the portal will take a save of comes with `canSave: true` (a
 *      copy its Plans Library keeps on this device, handed to the portal's
 *      own copy of this app in its frame, for a person who may save back).
 *      Save then hands the whole saved project to the portal:
 *        {type: 'ptt-save', v, nonce, req, name, size, file}
 *      and waits for `{type: 'ptt-save-state', v, nonce, req, state, why?}`:
 *      'kept' (the portal has the bytes in its own storage — only then is the
 *      project saved), 'refused', 'no-room' or 'failed'. While it keeps them it
 *      may say so — `{..., state: 'keeping', pct?}` — and each one that says
 *      it got further (a `pct` more than before) starts the wait again: a
 *      big plan takes more than the wait to copy on an iPad. Sending to
 *      OneDrive is the portal's job after that; it may say how it goes
 *      ('sending' with a `pct`, 'sent', 'copy' with the copy's `name`), and
 *      nothing here waits for those. A 'kept' that comes after the wait has
 *      ended is still heard (the caller decides whether it is a save then).
 *
 * Two windows can be the portal (the PEER, portalPeer):
 *
 *   · the window that opened this tab (a computer: this app on its own site),
 *     at a portal address (PORTAL_ORIGINS);
 *   · the page this one is framed in, when it is a page of this page's own
 *     site (a phone or a tablet: the portal shows its own copy of this app,
 *     /takeoff/, in a frame over the page) — at this page's own address.
 *
 * A message counts only when it comes from that window, from that address,
 * with this tab's nonce, and in exactly this shape. Everything here is pure,
 * so the Node tests drive it with made-up messages and made-up windows.

 * before it for this save — starts the wait again from now, for the whole

 * to copy on an iPad. Nothing else does: a 'keeping' at the same how-far, or
 * with none, or any of SAVE_NEWS, is passed on (onNews) and the wait goes on.
 * A copy that has stopped (a read that never comes back) may still be told
 * as 'keeping' now and then by a timer, at the same how-far; it must end in
 * the wait, as any silence does, never keep Save waiting for ever. 1% of the
 * largest plan the portal takes (4 GiB) in 2 minutes is about 0.36 MB/s: a
 * copy slower than that has stopped. A portal that says nothing before its
 * answer is waited for exactly as before.
 *
 * Time the page spends hidden is not counted (as workerWriter's watchdog,
 * js/core/device-plans.js). Switching apps while the portal spools a big plan
 * suspends the portal's page and this frame together; this page's timer runs
 * on a clock that kept going, so on the way back it is already overdue and
 * would end the wait — "not saved" — a moment before the portal's 'kept'
 * arrives, while the portal goes on to send the file. So a wait that comes
 * due while the page is hidden, or after it has been hidden since the save
 * was posted (or since the wait last started again), starts again from now,
 * for the whole window.
 *
 * Resolves { ending, why, stop, late }:
 *   ending  'kept' — the portal has the bytes in its own storage: the ONE
 *                    answer that makes this a save
 *           'refused' | 'no-room' | 'failed' — the portal's answer
 *           'timeout'  — no answer within waitMs
 *           'gone'     — the portal's window closed first
 *           'not-sent' — the save could not be handed over at all
 *   why     the portal's short words ('' when none)
 *   late    after a 'timeout', a Promise of the portal's answer if it still
 *           comes — { state, why }, state one of SAVE_ENDINGS — or null once
 *           stop() is called; null at once for any other ending. A late
 *           'kept' says the portal HAS the file as it was composed: whether
 *           the project is saved then is the caller's to judge (nothing done
 *           since: js/core/save-route.js savedStill), and only for the latest
 *           save it handed over — it calls stop() before it posts the next.
 *           After a late 'kept' the news of the send is heard as after one in
 *           time.
 *   stop()  stops listening. After 'kept' the listener stays for the news of
 *           the send, until 'sent', 'copy' or 'failed'; after 'timeout', for
 *           a late answer (and then as after 'kept'); until this either way.
