// saved-overlay.js — the overlay the desktop saved for a sheet, put up when
// he arrives on it, and taken down whenever he leaves. LOOKING ONLY: nothing
// here writes a record, marks the project or moves its change count.
//
// The desktop (_restore_overlay_for_page) puts a sheet's saved overlay up on
// every arrival: another sheet, a revision of it, or a picture of it, in its
// own tint, fade and look (js/core/overlay-look.js). This is that, for the
// web, as a small state machine its host (js/main.js) drives from the page
// turns and the version steps:
//
//   turn(page, how)   goToPage's first word. The LAST sheet's overlay comes
//                     down here, always, before anything can be restored --
//                     never behind an early return (before 3.08 the
//                     desktop's revision branch returned without it, and
//                     left the last sheet's comparison up over this one;
//                     3.08 takes it down there too). A
//                     'keep' of the sheet he is on (a save's re-read), and
//                     its own card tapped again, are the same visit and
//                     keep it (the card asks again for one whose read
//                     failed, as offline).
//   settle(...)       the drawing he landed on is up, or a version step
//                     changed it: put this sheet's overlay up if its record
//                     names something it can show -- on the sheet's OWN
//                     drawing only. On another version it is not drawn (the
//                     desktop's paint gate, 'never over another version');
//                     landing there, he is told once that the overlay is on
//                     the sheet's own drawing and how to get to it. (The
//                     desktop lands on the own drawing instead while an
//                     overlay is up; the web stays on the newest so the
//                     takeoff stays editable -- the user's decision.)
//   hide()            Hide / Escape: down for this visit; the next arrival
//                     brings it back. Writes nothing.
//   stepAside()       Compare (the version bar's red/blue) goes up: one
//                     overlay on screen at a time. Down for the rest of the
//                     visit -- it does not come back when Compare ends.
//   flash()           blink at the desktop's default speed (Medium, 0.7 s).
//   takeDown()        a job opened or reset: down, its bitmap closed.
//
// The mask is built once per arrival (source, decode size, look) and held
// here, outside the page store's LRU, so a page turn elsewhere can never
// evict it; it is closed whenever the overlay comes down. The tint and the
// fade are applied when it is drawn (frame()): a tint or a fade is never a
// rebuild.
