/**
 * A File-shaped handle to a project that lives on a server.
 *
 * The reader never wants a whole file. It wants `size` up front and then a
 * handful of small `slice()`s — opening the estimator's 2.3 GB job costs about
 * 2 KB, and each sheet is fetched only when it is drawn. HTTP has had exactly
 * that operation since 1999, so a project on a server needs no download at
 * all: one Range request per slice. Opening the 155 MB Cooper Road plan set
 * over the network reads the same ~2 KB it reads from disk.
 *
 * That is why this exists rather than `await res.blob()`. Downloading first
 * would undo decision 1 of the whole port — nothing reads the whole file — and
 * a phone cannot hold 2.3 GB no matter how patient the estimator is.
 *
 * Measured against SharePoint's pre-authed download URLs, which is what the
 * portal hands over: `206 Partial Content`, `accept-ranges: bytes`,
 * `access-control-allow-origin: *`, and a preflight that allows `range`.
 *
 * Two things a server may do that would otherwise corrupt a read, both handled:
 *
 *   · **Ignore Range and answer 200 with the whole body.** The bytes are then
 *     the entire file, not the slice asked for. Trusting them would hand sheet
 *     1's pixels back for every sheet. The body is kept and sliced locally
 *     instead — one download, not one per sheet.
 *
 *   · **Expire the URL mid-session.** SharePoint's last about an hour and an
 *     afternoon on a plan set outruns that, so a slice that comes back 401/403
 *     mints a fresh URL and retries. Every slice that failed on the same
 *     expiry shares one renewal, and a slice that failed on a URL already
 *     replaced skips straight to the retry.
 *
 * Offsets are clamped into the file and treated as non-negative. `Blob.slice`
 * accepts negative offsets to mean "from the end"; nothing in the reader uses
 * them, and silently mapping them wrong is worse than not supporting them.
