// counting.js — WHAT COUNTS. Which piece of takeoff is in the totals, how much
// it adds, and every sentence that says so.
//
// A sheet can carry takeoff on several of its drawings — its own, and every
// revision that reissued it — and exactly ONE of them is in the totals: the
// one metadata.sheet_version books for it, the sheet's own drawing when there
// is no entry. Adding them all up would count the same wall twice on every
// report, which is what this app did until 3.05: it priced EVERY revision's
// takeoff, so the same file came to a different total here than on the
// desktop. On one real job the desktop priced 0 sq ft and this app 2,929.2.
//
// So this file is a PORT, not a design. Every method below is the desktop
// method of the same name (pdf_fast_viewer.py, PDFCacheViewer), line for line,
// and tests/revision-counting.mjs runs the desktop's own methods — lifted out
// of its source by text, as a closure — against these on the same inputs, so
// the two programs cannot disagree on a total without a red test.
//
// THE RULE THAT OUTRANKS EVERYTHING: a quantity that reaches the estimate
// must not change without a sentence on screen saying so, and the sentence
// names the QUANTITY. Looking never moves a price. The sentences are here,
// worded by the desktop's own functions (takeoff_move_words and friends), so
// "36 sq ft of Slab will leave" reads the same on both screens.
//
// Nothing here touches the DOM, and nothing here writes the project: a
// booking is RETURNED as data and the caller applies it inside the same undo
// step as the takeoff that caused it.

 * added exactly, as ints; the first float is added to that with one plain
 * `+`; and only from there on are the bits each addition loses carried
 * (Neumaier's compensated sum, cs_add / cs_to_double) and added back at the
 * end. The desktop is built on 3.14, so a multi-shape item's total re-added
 * here with a plain `+` came out one bit off the desktop's -- 893.137374777004
 * against 893.1373747770041.
 *
 * Which numbers are ints is a fact of the TEXT, and the text is this app's:
 * JSON.stringify writes every whole number below 1e21 with no point -- a run
 * the desktop held as 180.0 is saved as 180 -- and Python reads that back as
 * an int. The desktop re-adds every multi-shape item from its runs whenever
 * it opens a job (_resync_group_totals), so this is the sum it re-adds from
 * a web save, and a total re-added here is the one it finds there, to the
 * bit. Compensating from the first number, as this did, missed by a bit
 * whenever a whole number came first, and the desktop then said on opening
 * that the item had been "re-added from its runs".
 *
 * What it cannot reach is a total the desktop added up itself and this app
 * saved untouched: added from 180.0 as a float, then re-added on opening from
 * 180 as an int, it can move one bit and be announced. That is the desktop's
 * to fix (compare totals past the last bit), not something a save may do.
