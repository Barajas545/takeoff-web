// page-store.js — page pixels, fetched and decoded on demand.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Measured against the estimator's live library: one
// sheet is 6300 × 4500 at 150 DPI, which is 113 MB once it is decoded to RGBA,
// and a job runs to 240 of them. Fully decoded that is 27 GB. The container
// itself reaches 2.3 GB, so it cannot be held as bytes either.
//
// So this store holds NO pixels and NO file bytes. It holds a File and a list
// of {offset, size}, fetches one page's compressed blob when that page is
// drawn, and keeps a handful of decoded ImageBitmaps in an LRU that closes
// what it evicts. Thumbnails are decoded once at a fraction of the size and
// kept, because the sheet list needs them all and they are small.
//
// A page's SOURCE is one of four things, and knowing which is what makes
// saving nearly free:
//   'slice'  a Blob slice of the opened file. Untouched. On save it is passed
//            straight through — no fetch, no decode, no re-encode.
//   'raw'    zlib(PNG) bytes we already hold.
//   'png'    PNG bytes we produced (a freshly imported PDF page).
//   'bitmap' pixels with no encoded form yet (a blank sheet we drew).
