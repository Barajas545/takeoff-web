/**
 * Where a finished project goes on a browser with no file handles — an iPad,
 * an iPhone, Firefox, Safari — and what the app may then say about it.
 *
 * Chrome and Edge on a computer write the project back into the file it came
 * from, and the browser says when that is done. Everywhere else the project
 * leaves as a NEW file, one of two ways, and neither of them is a write the
 * app can watch finish:
 *
 *   · the share sheet (navigator.share with the file). The estimator picks
 *     where it goes — Save to Files, OneDrive, Mail — and share() resolves
 *     only once they have. That is the one answer on an iPad that says the
 *     file went somewhere. But WebKit reads the WHOLE file into memory before
 *     the sheet even opens (ShareDataReader: every byte into an ArrayBuffer,
 *     then copied for the system's side), and it will only open the sheet
 *     within about five seconds of a tap (transient activation, consumed by
 *     share()). A read that fails is reported as AbortError — the very name a
 *     person dismissing the sheet gets;
 *
 *   · an <a download> of the file. The browser streams it to Downloads from
 *     the parts it is made of, half a megabyte at a time, so it works at any
 *     size — but on an iPad nothing comes back to the page: not whether
 *     Safari asked "Do you want to download?", not whether the person said
 *     yes, not whether an app opened from the home-screen icon downloaded
 *     anything at all. On a computer it is the save, and always has been: a
 *     Firefox download lands in Downloads and that is the whole story there.
 *
 * Until now every one of those endings was called "Saved", the project was
 * marked saved, and the unsaved-work draft was thrown away — including the
 * ending where nothing at all had happened. On a phone that is how an hour of
 * takeoff disappears with a cheerful message. So the rules here:
 *
 *   1. Only a CONFIRMED ending marks the project saved: a write through a
 *      handle, a share that resolved, the portal saying it has kept a save
 *      handed back to it ('kept', inside the portal: savesToPortal), or a
 *      download on a computer. All but the last drop the draft — a
 *      computer's download is the save there, but the browser may have
 *      asked where to put it and been told no, so the draft stays behind
 *      it, and goes by itself when a newer file is opened (offerDraftRestore
 *      in main.js drops a draft older than the file it is offered for).
 *   2. A download on a phone or a tablet is "started", never "saved": the
 *      project stays unsaved, the draft stays, and the person is told where to
 *      look and what to do if nothing came. So is a download on ANY device
 *      that follows a share sheet that could not read the file: the download
 *      reads the same bytes, and when those are gone (a plan OneDrive
 *      replaced on disk after it was opened) it fails too, with nothing said.
 *   3. When it is not clear whether the person said no or the browser failed,
 *      the answer that keeps the work wins. A draft is written before the
 *      save begins — but a draft can only be offered back when a file it
 *      belongs to is opened again (one with the same name, size and sheet
 *      count), so the words say the work is "kept" only when that is so
 *      (draftHomeFor), and otherwise that it is in this open page alone.
 *   4. Only the project that was saved, as it was when it was composed, is
 *      marked saved: anything done while the file was on its way out (the
 *      share sheet reads a big file for seconds before it opens) or another
 *      project opened meanwhile leaves the open one unsaved (savedStill).
 *
 * Everything here is pure — no DOM, no navigator — so tests/save-route.mjs
 * drives every ending with made-up browsers. main.js supplies the real share,
 * the real download and the real "Your file is ready" dialog.

/* ── where a draft can come back from ───────────────────────────────────────

   A draft (js/core/drafts.js) is keyed by a file's name and size, and it is
   offered back only when a file of that name and size is opened again — and
   only if that file has as many sheets as the draft was measured against
   (offerDraftRestore in main.js: measurements are keyed by sheet index). So
   a project's "homes" are the files it may be reopened from:
   { name, size, pages }. The file it was opened from, and the last file it
   was saved into — after Save to Files › Replace on an iPad the plan IS that
   file, at a new size, and a draft written under the old size alone would
