// items-panel.js — the PROJECT ITEMS tree.
//
// THE TREE IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED. Every rebuild walks the flat measurement
// store and nests items by three string fields on each item: floor_level,
// category, sub_category. Ordering inside every level is by sort_order, and a
// group's position is the MINIMUM sort_order of the items under it.
//
// Introducing a persisted tree here would be a bug, not a feature: an older
// .takeoff file has no such structure, and two sources of truth for where an
// item sits is exactly how items go missing from an estimate.
